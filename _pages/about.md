Hello and welcome! I am a recent graduate in Molecular and Cell Biology at Uniformed Services University in Bethesda, MD. My thesis work was under the advisorship of Dr. Rachel Cox, and my work aimed to elucidate the function and composition of the mitochondria-associated,ribonucleoprotein <b>Clueless</b> as well as its potential role in mitochondrial function and translation of mitochondrial proteins in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>. I completed my undergraduate degree in Biology at Georgia Institute of Technology. After completion of my undergraduate degree, I completed a tenure as a Biologist ORISE Fellow within the Newborn Screening and Molecular Biology Branch at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, working on congenital hypothyroidism and hemoglobinopathies within the Newborn Screening Quality Assurance Program, and subsequently enrolled in the Molecular and Cell Biology Ph.D. program at USUHS. In the future, I plan to continue pursuing her research interests in mitochondrial disease and dysregulation and mechanisms which maintain mitochondrial integrity.
